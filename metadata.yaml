description: "Geological Evidences of the Antiquity of Man is a book written by British\
  \ geologist, Charles Lyell in 1863. The first three editions appeared in February,\
  \ April, and November 1863, respectively. A much-revised fourth edition appeared\
  \ in 1873. Antiquity of Man, as it was known to contemporary readers, dealt with\
  \ three scientific issues that had become prominent in the preceding decade: the\
  \ age of the human race, the existence of ice ages, and Charles Darwin's theory\
  \ of evolution by natural selection. Lyell used the book to reverse or modify his\
  \ own long-held positions on all three issues. The book drew sharp criticism from\
  \ two of Lyell's younger colleagues – paleontologist Hugh Falconer and archaeologist\
  \ John Lubbock – who felt that Lyell had used their work too freely and acknowledged\
  \ it too sparingly. It sold well, however, and (along with Lubbock's 1865 book Prehistoric\
  \ Times) helped to establish the new science of prehistoric archaeology in Great\
  \ Britain.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
